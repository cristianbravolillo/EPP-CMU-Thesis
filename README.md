EPP-CMU-Thesis
==============

A non-official template for a PhD thesis at Engineering and Public Policy (EPP) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

History
-------

During 2013 I spent quite a while trying to understand the multiple requirements to put together my PhD thesis for
Engineering and Public Policy (EPP) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Besides having many tables, list of questions
coming from surveys, graphics, statistical data, and a lot of code to put in, I also had to deal with a lot of editorial
requirements (e.g., "*this is how* your cover page should look like"). Since there are no official templates for a phd
thesis (which makes no sense to me since it's something we all PhD students have to go through), here's my attempt to save
you the pain to do it.

While this template was created with EPP in mind (and every department has its own requirements), you may tweak it to your
own purposes.


Official sources of information
-------------------------------

You should always consult with the administrator of your department. As of May 2014, the official source of information for
thesis guidelines in Carnegie Mellon University is http://www.cit.cmu.edu/current_students/graduates/thesis_dissertation_policies.html.
For EPP guidelines, you should go to https://www.epp.cmu.edu/graduate/thesis_format_guide.html.
